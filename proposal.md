# Final Project Propsal 

For my final project, I'd like to make the first high fidelity prototype of my thesis. The March 23rd deadline will really help move me forward. This will also builds off the CRUD and database assignments. 

The idea is to create an interactive web-based creativity experiment. It is a guided experience that navigates through ordered phases/pages. Users will perform a creativity task judge the responses of participants that came before them, and enter a short reflection about their evaluation. 

Behind the scenes, the website is collecting user input (in the form of typed text), storing it in a database and analyzing it. At the end of the experience, these analyses will be presented back to the users on the front-end. 

Here is a short [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XnxGScPYshnq3fZm0j513QkJe8pNnjDW-kVrlYDdtBk/edit?usp=sharing) for the general planned flow.
Part one (though with no visual flair yet) is already finished thanks to our past two assignments :)
